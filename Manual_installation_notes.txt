Use this command to install on another machine:
pip3 install --user -e git+https://github.com/MojaveTom/ProgramParametersForPython#egg=progparams
Then start python3 from the command line; import sys; and sys.path
to see where pip put your installation.  Put that path in VSCode's
python extra paths so the IDE can find the installation.

This will clone the repository *somewhere*.  If you edit the sources, you
can push the changes back to the repository.
